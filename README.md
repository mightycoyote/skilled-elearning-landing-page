## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Vite (to compile the Sass; there's no JS in this project)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive images (with HTML srcset and picture)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was the first project I had done with an extensive collection of different graphic assets for the hero image at different screen sizes. There were not only differences in resolution, but also some art direction where different versions of the graphic were to be loaded at different breakpoints. This required using not only HTML `srcset`, but `<picture>` as well.

### Useful resources

- ["Images on the Web" series - Kevin Powell](https://youtu.be/2QYpkrX2N48) - This 3-part series explains HTML `srcset`, image types (including `.webp`), and `<picture>`.
